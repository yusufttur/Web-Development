# JavaScript Basics

## Variables
* JavaScript uses the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords to declare variables. `var` is the oldest way to declare a variable and has function scope, meaning it is accessible within the entire function it was declared in. `let` and `const` were introduced in `ECMAScript 6` and have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they were declared in. `const` is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned.

## Primitive Types
* JavaScript has six primitive types: `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `symbol`, and `null`.

## Reference Types
JavaScript also has reference types, which are objects that are stored in memory. Examples of reference types include `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, and `Date`.

## Functions
* Functions are blocks of code that can be executed when called. They can take `parameters` and `return` a value. Functions can be declared using the function keyword or using arrow function syntax.

## Operators
* JavaScript has various operators such as `arithmetic operators`, `comparison operators`, `logical operators`, and more.

## Date Objects
* JavaScript has a built-in Date object that can be used to work with dates and times.

## String Methods
* JavaScript has several built-in methods for working with strings such as `.length`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.indexOf()`, and more.

## Number Methods
* JavaScript has several built-in methods for working with numbers such as `.toFixed()`, `.toString()`, `.valueOf()`, and more.

## Arrays
* JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can be manipulated using various built-in methods such as `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`, and more.

## Conditional Statements
* JavaScript has `if-else statements` that allow you to execute different code depending on whether a condition is true or false. You can also use `switch-case statements` to execute different code based on the value of a variable.

## Loops
* JavaScript has several looping constructs such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. These can be used to repeat code multiple times.

## Template literals
* Template literals are a new way to declare strings in ES6, they are enclosed by backticks rather than single/double quotes and allow you to embed expressions easily using `${expression}`

## Object literals
* Object literals are a way to create objects in JavaScript using the `{}` notation. Properties and methods can be added to the object using key-value pairs.

## Loops in Arrays and Objects
* JavaScript provides several ways to loop through arrays and objects, such as `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` methods.
