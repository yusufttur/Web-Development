# CSS Grid Webpage

* Welcome to this CSS Grid webpage project! This project demonstrates the use of the CSS Grid layout system to create a responsive, grid-based layout for a webpage.

## Getting Started
* These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
* To run this project, you will need to have a web browser and a code editor installed on your computer.

## Installing
* To get started, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can open the **index.html** file in your web browser to view the webpage.

* To make changes to the project, you can open the files in your code editor. The main CSS file for the project is located in the css folder and is named **style.css**. This file contains the CSS Grid code for the layout of the webpage.

## CSS Grid
* This project makes use of CSS Grid to create a **responsive**, **grid-based layout** for the webpage. The CSS Grid layout system allows for the creation of grid-based layouts using CSS, making it well-suited for building responsive websites.

* In this project, a grid container is created and its display property is set to grid. The **grid-template-columns** and **grid-template-rows** properties are used to define the structure of the grid, with values determining the size of the columns and rows. Elements are placed inside the grid using the **grid-row** and **grid-column** properties, which take values that correspond to the rows and columns that the element should be placed in.

* The **align-items** and **justify-items** properties are used to control the alignment of elements within the grid cells, allowing for vertical and horizontal alignment.
