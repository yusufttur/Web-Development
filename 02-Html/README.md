## Prerequisites
* To run this project, you will need to have a web browser and a code editor installed on your computer.

## Installing
* To get started, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can open the **index.html** file in your web browser to view the webpage.

## Developing
* To make changes to the project, you can open the files in your code editor. The main HTML file for the project is located in the root of the repository and is named **index.html**. This file contains the HTML code for the form and the layout of the webpage.

## HTML Form
* This project makes use of HTML forms to create a user-friendly and interactive webpage. Forms allow users to input data and interact with the webpage, making it a crucial element of many websites.

* In this project, a form is created using the **< form >** element. Input fields, such as text boxes and radio buttons, are created using the **< input >** element, along with various attributes to specify their type and properties. Labels for the input fields are created using the **< label >** element.

* The form also includes a submit button, created using the **< input >** element with the type attribute set to "submit". The form's action attribute is set to specify where the form data should be sent when the submit button is clicked.

* Form validation is also implemented in this project to ensure that the form is filled out correctly before it is submitted. This is done using HTML pattern attribute and required attribute.

## Built With
- HTML

## Conclusion
* This project is just a simple example of how to use HTML forms, but the possibilities for creating interactive and user-friendly webpages with forms are endless. Feel free to use this project as a starting point for your own form-based projects and happy coding!
