# Calculator with basic JS
* This task is a JavaScript function that implements a basic calculator. 
* The function prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator, then performs the specified operation and displays the result on the page using document.write.
* The function first checks if the inputs are valid numbers, then checks if the operator is one of the four valid operators (+, -, *, /). 
* If both checks pass, the function performs the specified operation and displays the result on the page. 
* If either the inputs or the operator are invalid, an error message is displayed.
